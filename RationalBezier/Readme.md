## Project description:
Implement a linear time O(n) algorithm for evaluating a rational Bezier curve C(u) at
parameter 0 ≤ u ≤ 1.

### Development environment
Visual Studio 2022 community visualc++ std::c++11 

 ### Algorithm Design

 Static linear memory for Factorial array.
 Linear memory & time for U and 1-u power sequance.
 Linear memory for NCR generation per Rational Bezier curve.
 Linear time eveluation for new interpolated values.
